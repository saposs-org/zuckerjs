# Saposs ZuckerJS
ZuckerJS is a simple JavaScript library which was given birth to assist any web developer to build any SPA web application by component-oriented architecture. It's free, fast and efficient and no required
dependencies.

This term "component-oriented architecture" can be understood as a set of all uncoupled components to form an application.
It sounds cool :), right? Your development tasks are only: write any component and then add them to ZuckerJS configurations
as below.

# Install and Usage
It's simple to install and use ZuckerJS, only in 3 following steps:
- Download ZuckerJS library "zucker.js" from source.
- Include it at the end of body tag.
- Configure ZuckerJS for application:

``` html
    <script>
        window.zucker.config([YOUR_COMPONENT_LIST_HERE]).execute();
    </script>
```

# How does ZuckerJS work?
Basically, ZuckerJS took advantage of browser's hash to route as well as connect all relevant components 
that have the same route.

For instance:
In SPA, each page own a route, view and business logics. View and business logics
are components that have the same route.

# Why using ZuckerJS?
- Component-oriented architecture.

If you want some of them, ZuckerJS will be a right decision for you.
